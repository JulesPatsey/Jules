# sp-page-context

This package defines the page context layer for the SharePoint Framework.
The page context allows an application and its web parts to share common
data about the current page, such as its contents, URL, list, permissions,
navigation menu, etc.

*This package is part of the [SharePoint Framework](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki),
which is a collection of NPM packages that empower developers to create client-side experiences
for [Microsoft SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration).
The SharePoint Framework is currently in Preview, and is subject to change based on customer feedback.
For more information, including API documentation and code samples, please visit the
[SharePoint Framework Developer Preview](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-docs/wiki) web site.*
